MXNetOnACL is a project that is maintained by **OPEN** AI LAB, it uses Arm Compute Library (NEON+GPU) to speed up [MXNet](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/) and provide utilities to debug, profile and tune application performance. 

The release version is 0.3.1, is based on [Rockchip RK3399](http://www.rock-chips.com/plus/3399.html) Platform, target OS is Ubuntu 16.04. Can download the source code from [OAID/MXNetOnACL](https://github.com/OAID/MXNetOnACL)

* The ARM Computer Vision and Machine Learning library is a set of functions optimised for both ARM CPUs and GPUs using SIMD technologies. See also [Arm Compute Library](https://github.com/ARM-software/ComputeLibrary).
* MXNet is a Lightweight, Portable, Flexible Distributed/Mobile Deep Learning with Dynamic, Mutation-aware Dataflow Dep Scheduler; for Python, R, Julia, Scala, Go, Javascript and more. See also [MXNet](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet).

### Arm Compute Library Compatibility Issues :
There are some compatibility issues between ACL and Caffe Layers, we bypass it to Caffe's original layer class as the workaround solution for the below issues

* Normalization in-channel issue
* Tanh issue
* Softmax supporting multi-dimension issue
* Group issue

Performance need be fine turned in the future
